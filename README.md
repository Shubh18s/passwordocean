### Are you also...

- Tired of juggling countless passwords for every app and service you use?
    
- Looking to avoid costly subscriptions to password managers that come with usage limits and require installation on all your devices?
    
- Anxious at the very thought of having to update all your passwords every time a major service gets compromised?
    

#### Well, fret not!

ps_gen is here to revolutionize your password generation and remembering needs. Get ready to experience true peace of mind, all without spending a penny or downloading a single piece of software!

### How ps_gen Works: It's That Simple!

To Generate a New Password:

1. Open the link in any web browser on any device.
    
2. Enter and remember a unique master passphrase that only you know, along with a distinct service name (e.g., Google, Facebook, Instagram).
    

- Important Note: Remember to spell your passphrase and service name exactly the same way every time, including capitalization and spacing!
    

3. Hit Generate Password.
    
4. Copy your newly generated unique and strong password, then use it with your service.
    
5. Close the browser. It's that simple!
    

To Get Your Password Again:

1. Open the link in a browser.
    
2. Enter your unique and secret master passphrase (the one only you know!) and the exact unique service name you used before (e.g., Google, or MyBank2025 if you rotated it).
    
3. Voila! Here's your password, ready to use!
    
4. Copy it and close the browser. It's that simple!
    

### Is This Safe, Though? Absolutely!

ps_gen is built with your security and privacy as the top priority. Here's why you can feel completely confident:

- Client-Side Only: The crucial distinction here is that ps_gen is designed to be client-side only. This means all the password generation magic happens right there in your own web browser. Your master passphrase is never sent over the internet, never stored on any server, and never saved anywhere after you close your browser.
    
- No Data Saved: As soon as you close the browser tab or window, any trace of your master passphrase or the generated password vanishes from your device's memory.
    
- Transparent Code: The code that powers ps_gen is open and visible (if hosted on a public platform like GitHub Pages). This transparency allows anyone to inspect how it works, building trust and ensuring there are no hidden tricks.
    

You're in complete control. Enjoy the freedom of strong, unique passwords without the worry!
