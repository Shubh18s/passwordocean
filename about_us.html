        <h1>About PasswordOcean</h1>

        <p>Welcome to PasswordOcean, your free, privacy-first solution for secure password management.</p>

        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>In an increasingly digital world, the burden of managing countless complex passwords has become a significant source of stress and vulnerability. Our mission at PasswordOcean is simple: to empower individuals with <strong>true password freedom</strong> by providing a tool that is <strong>secure, private, free, and incredibly easy to use.</strong></p>
        <p>We believe that strong online security shouldn't come at the cost of your privacy or require expensive subscriptions.</p>

        <h3>The Problem We Solve</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Password Fatigue:</strong> Remembering dozens of unique, strong passwords is nearly impossible.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Risks:</strong> Reusing passwords across multiple sites leaves you highly vulnerable to data breaches.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy Concerns:</strong> Many password managers require you to trust them with your most sensitive data in the cloud.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost & Complexity:</strong> Secure password solutions often come with a price tag or steep learning curves.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Our Unique Approach</h3>
        <p>PasswordOcean stands apart by leveraging a <strong>deterministic, client-side approach</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>One Master Passphrase:</strong> You only need to remember one powerful, secret passphrase.</li>
            <li><strong>In-Browser Generation:</strong> All password magic happens directly within your web browser. Your master passphrase and service names <strong>never leave your device</strong> and are <strong>never stored</strong> by us.</li>
            <li><strong>Deterministic Algorithm:</strong> For any given master passphrase and service name, the same unique password will *always* be generated, consistently, on any device, anytime. No syncing required!</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy by Design:</strong> Our core principle is zero data retention of sensitive information. We don't want your passwords, and we don't store them.</li>
            <li><strong>Absolutely Free:</strong> We are committed to keeping PasswordOcean accessible to everyone, without any hidden costs or subscriptions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Who We Are</h3>
        <p>PasswordOcean was created by a passionate Data Engineer with a background in Data Science and extensive experience in highly regulated industries like Banking and Healthcare.
